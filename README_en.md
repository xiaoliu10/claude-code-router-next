![](blog/images/claude-code.png)

## ✨ Features

- **Model Routing**: Route requests to different models based on your needs (e.g., background tasks, thinking, long context).
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports various model providers like OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, Volcengine, and SiliconFlow.
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Customize requests and responses for different providers using transformers.
- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Switch models on-the-fly within Claude Code using the `/model` command.
- **CLI Model Management**: Manage models and providers directly from the terminal with `ccr model`.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Trigger Claude Code tasks in your GitHub workflows.
- **Usage Statistics & Quota Monitoring**: Tracks tokens, cache hits, Time to First Token (TTFT), and generation speed (tokens/sec) for each request, with real-time tracking of quotas and reset times for major providers.
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom transformers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

You can install Claude Code Router either from the npm registry or directly from this GitHub repository for the latest development version.

#### Option A: Install from npm registry (Stable)

First, ensure you have [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart) installed:

```shell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then, install Claude Code Router:

```shell
npm install -g @wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next
```

#### Option B: Install from GitHub (Latest Development Version)

If you want to use the latest features and bug fixes directly from the source code:

1. **Uninstall the current version first** (to prevent command conflicts):
   ```shell
   npm uninstall -g @wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next @musistudio/claude-code-router @wengine-ai/claude-code-router
   ```

2. **Clone and link locally** (recommended for developers):
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/xiaoliu10/claude-code-router-next.git
   cd claude-code-router-next
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   npm link
   ```

   *Alternatively, install directly from GitHub globally:*
   ```shell
   npm install -g github:xiaoliu10/claude-code-router-next
   ```

#### 🔄 Migrating from the Official Upstream (@musistudio/claude-code-router)

If you are currently using the upstream community version `@musistudio/claude-code-router` or the previous version `@wengine-ai/claude-code-router` and want to switch to `@wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next`:

1. **Uninstall the old version**:
   ```shell
   npm uninstall -g @musistudio/claude-code-router @wengine-ai/claude-code-router
   ```

2. **Install this version**:
   ```shell
   npm install -g @wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next
   ```

> **Note**: Your existing configuration at `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` is **not affected** by uninstalling the old package. The new version will automatically read your existing configuration.

### Upgrade

```shell
npm install -g @wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next@latest && ccr restart
```

### 📅 Changelog (Release History)

| Version | Release Details |
| --- | --- |
| **v2.3.2432** | <ul><li><strong>Gemini independent quota pools (Argon / Hydrogen / Claude, plugin 1.0.13)</strong>: the provider card shows per-model-family pools instead of one aggregate — an exhausted Argon pool is visible at a glance (no more "weekly 71% yet 429" confusion).</li><li><strong>restart falls back to the real port listener on a stale PID file</strong>: fixes "page update keeps failing" — a corpse PID in the file meant nothing was killed and the respawn hit EADDRINUSE forever; now an identity-checked port fallback + wait-for-release + PID written only after a successful bind.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2431** | <ul><li><strong>Kiro refusals no longer trigger cooldown &amp; quota restored (plugin 0.1.2)</strong>: upstream <code>CONTENT_FILTERED</code> / <code>REASONING_EXTRACTION</code> empty refusal streams now classify as <code>kiro_content_filtered</code> (422) instead of <code>kiro_stream_truncated</code> (502) and no longer park the account for 5 minutes; read-only usage/model sync remain available during 429 cooldowns, <code>fetchQuota</code> surfaces Kiro credits on the Providers view, and expired active bonuses are excluded.</li><li><strong>Plugin upgrade-loop fix &amp; stale-dist guards</strong>: fixed <code>kiro@0.1.1</code> shipping a stale <code>0.1.0</code> manifest; catalog <code>updateAvailable</code> now uses <code>semver</code> so newer local builds never prompt a downgrade, archive installation rejects mismatched <code>package.json</code> / <code>plugin.json</code> versions, and Kiro adds <code>prepack</code> build enforcement.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2430** | <ul><li><strong>Gemini OAuth long-conversation 400 fix (plugin 1.0.11)</strong>: unsigned tool-call history gets a skip-validation sentinel; fabricated/malformed/foreign (GLM 24-hex) signatures are rejected before they reach Google; a schema-bearing client <code>web_search</code> is no longer converted into Google built-in search. The reported 111-message/39-tool session replays with HTTP 200 on both streaming and non-streaming lanes.</li><li><strong>Gemini streaming cache usage restored (plugin 1.0.11)</strong>: the trailing empty-text frame carrying <code>cachedContentTokenCount</code> and <code>finishReason</code> is no longer dropped wholesale; streamed turns now record cache hits, final token counts and the stop reason (live replay of a ~93k-token prompt reports 91,067 cached tokens, previously always 0).</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2429** | <ul><li><strong>Codex manual usage reset</strong>: the card shows gifted reset credits (upstream-owned); a confirmation dialog is the only spend path; a synchronous latch rejects concurrent double-clicks and retries reuse the idempotency key so a lost response cannot double-spend; kiro 0.1.1 ships with this release.</li><li><strong>Gemini transport &amp; quota fixes</strong>: recognize Code Assist SSE without a Content-Type; real quota via the shared pipeline; recovered requests no longer leave a stale failure banner.</li><li><strong>Exact model routing fix</strong>: provider-exposed model ids short-circuit family routing — Gemini’s Claude models are reachable by name again.</li><li><strong>Codex dropped-login fix</strong>: strip the thinking field from Responses input (the upstream 400 root cause); successful output clears error residue.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2428** | <ul><li><strong>Quota adapter gzip fix</strong>: proxied quota requests pin <code>Accept-Encoding: identity</code> so an undecoded gzip body can no longer fail the parse and hide the provider quota (Zhipu and similar providers show usage again).</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2427** | <ul><li><strong>Expired quota window fix</strong>: a window whose reset has passed is no longer presented as current usage; the card falls back to the local token count instead of a frozen percentage.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2426** | <ul><li><strong>Gemini (Antigravity) model hide/restore</strong>: the card lists visible model chips with hide buttons plus a hidden list with restore/restore-all; hiding clears Router references with a first-visible default and rolls back completely on failure.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2425** | <ul><li><strong>Provider drag-and-drop reordering</strong>: drag a provider card to reorder the list; the order is written to the config immediately. Drags resolve by stable row id, so they stay correct while the list is search-filtered, and unnamed providers can be dragged too.</li><li><strong>grok and cursor cards follow the family style</strong>: shared button vocabulary, sizes, icons and destructive variant, so all seven provider cards look alike.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2424** | <ul><li>**New Kiro subscription provider plugin**: Kiro portal / AWS Builder ID / IAM Identity Center OAuth sign-in, runtime region derived from the profile ARN, multi-account card and quota management.</li><li>**Estimated-usage provenance**: the usage store gains an additive <code>usage_estimated</code> column (schema v3); estimates are never presented as metered figures and no longer feed the cache-read heuristic.</li></ul> |
| **v2.3.2423** | <ul><li>**New Grok and Cursor subscription provider plugins**: Grok via official CLI device sign-in; Cursor via browser / cursor-agent CLI / API key (HTTP/1-only under the subscription proxy), each with model management and a usage card.</li><li>**Responses streams convert per client format**: fixes native Responses frames reaching Chat/Anthropic clients as empty turns; short turns no longer show the upstream model as <code>unknown</code>; inline answers in terminal frames are no longer dropped.</li><li>**Automatic daily check-in/claim for the Qoder and WorkBuddy CN sites** (startup jitter, bounded same-day retries), manual buttons retained.</li></ul> |

### 2. Configuration

Create and configure your `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` file. For more details, you can refer to `config.example.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important Note**: After manually modifying the `config.json` file (such as updating API keys, Aliyun console cookies, etc.), **you must restart the service for the changes to take effect**. After saving your changes, run the following command in your terminal:
> ```shell
> ccr restart
> ```

The `config.json` file has several key sections:

- **`PROXY_URL`** (optional): You can set a proxy for API requests, for example: `"PROXY_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:7890"`. The CCR process itself connects to the proxy port via this address — no system-wide proxy, TUN mode, or proxy-app global mode is required.
- **`PROXY_GLOBAL_ENABLED`** (optional): Controls the scope of the proxy. When unconfigured or set to `true` (default), all providers' outbound traffic goes through the proxy, preserving backward compatibility with existing configs. When set to `false`, only providers marked with `proxy_enabled: true` use the proxy; all other providers connect directly. All providers share the single top-level `PROXY_URL` — per-provider proxy URLs are not supported. If `PROXY_URL` is not set (empty), all proxy switches are ineffective and every connection is direct. Provider-specific outbound requests (inference, fallback, health probes, quota queries, wakeup, provider API tokenizer, etc.) all follow the same per-provider proxy policy.
  > [!WARNING]
  > The proxy can see your API keys and request payloads — only configure a trusted proxy.
- **`LOG`** (optional): You can enable logging by setting it to `true`. When set to `false`, no log files will be created. Default is `true`.
- **`LOG_LEVEL`** (optional): Set the logging level. Available options are: `"fatal"`, `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"trace"`. Default is `"error"`; detailed logs are emitted only when explicitly set to `"info"`, `"debug"`, or `"trace"`.
- **Logging Systems**: The Claude Code Router uses two separate logging systems:
  - **Server-level logs**: HTTP requests, API calls, and server events are logged using pino in the `~/.claude-code-router/logs/` directory with filenames like `ccr-*.log`
  - **Application-level logs**: Routing decisions and business logic events are logged in `~/.claude-code-router/claude-code-router.log`
- **`APIKEY`** (optional): You can set a secret key to authenticate requests. When set, clients must provide this key in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer your-secret-key`) or the `x-api-key` header. Example: `"APIKEY": "your-secret-key"`.
- **`HOST`** (optional): You can set the host address for the server. If `APIKEY` is not set, the host will be forced to `127.0.0.1` for security reasons to prevent unauthorized access. Example: `"HOST": "0.0.0.0"`.
- **`NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE`** (optional): When set to `true`, enables compatibility with non-interactive environments like GitHub Actions, Docker containers, or other CI/CD systems. This sets appropriate environment variables (`CI=true`, `FORCE_COLOR=0`, etc.) and configures stdin handling to prevent the process from hanging in automated environments. Example: `"NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE": true`.

- **`Providers`**: Used to configure different model providers.
- **`Router`**: Used to set up routing rules. `default` specifies the default model, which will be used for all requests if no other route is configured.
- **`API_TIMEOUT_MS`**: Specifies the timeout for API calls in milliseconds.

#### Environment Variable Interpolation

Claude Code Router supports environment variable interpolation for secure API key management. You can reference environment variables in your `config.json` using either `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:

```json
{
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "${GEMINI_API_KEY}",
  "Providers": [
    {
      "name": "openai",
      "api_base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      "api_key": "$OPENAI_API_KEY",
      "models": ["gpt-5", "gpt-5-mini"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows you to keep sensitive API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in configuration files. The interpolation works recursively through nested objects and arrays.

Here is a comprehensive example:

```json
{
  "APIKEY": "your-secret-key",
  "PROXY_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",

### 🔑 Alibaba Cloud Bailian Quota Token (Cookie) Guide

If you want the Claude Code Router UI to fetch and display your monthly **Qwen Coding Plan** quota progress bars, you need to configure your console session `Cookie` as `quotaToken` in your configuration:

1. Log in to the [Alibaba Cloud Bailian Console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/).
2. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and switch to the **Network** tab.
3. Click the **Refresh** (用量刷新) button on the console's usage cards.
4. Look for an API request starting with `api.json?action=BroadScope...` in the network log.
5. Select the request, find the **`Cookie`** header under **Request Headers**, and copy its entire value.
6. Paste this copied cookie string as the **`quotaToken`** property inside the Alibaba Cloud provider block in your `config.json`.

Once configured, the Provider list in the Web UI will display your real-time Qwen Coding Plan remaining quota progress bar and refresh status:

![Alibaba Cloud Quota Progress Display](blog/images/aliyun-quota-display.png)

### 🔑 Xfyun Coding Plan Quota Token (Cookie) Guide

If you want the Claude Code Router UI to fetch and display your Xfyun Coding Plan quota bars in real time, open the Xfyun Coding Plan subscription/quota page, open DevTools Network, refresh the page, and copy the request `Cookie` as `quotaToken`:

1. Log in to the Xfyun Coding Plan subscription/quota page.
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and switch to the **Network** tab.
3. Refresh the page.
4. In the request list, find the quota-query request for that page and click it.
5. Under **Headers** → **Request Headers**, copy the full `Cookie` value.
6. Paste it into the `quotaToken` field in your `config.json`, or into the **Quota Query Token** input in the UI.

> **Note**: This token is not long-lived and may expire. When it expires, you need to add it again manually.

### 3. Running Claude Code with the Router

Start Claude Code using the router:

```shell
ccr code
```

> **Note**: After modifying the configuration file, you need to restart the service for the changes to take effect:
>
> ```shell
> ccr restart
> ```

### 4. UI Mode

For a more intuitive experience, you can use the UI mode to manage your configuration:

```shell
ccr ui
```

This will open a web-based interface where you can easily view and edit your `config.json` file.

![UI](/blog/images/ui.png)

#### Usage Statistics

The dashboard includes a built-in **Usage Statistics** panel at the bottom of the main page. Once your requests are routed through Claude Code Router, usage records are collected automatically and displayed in the UI.

You can use it to view:

- Total requests
- Input and output tokens
- Average TTFT
- Average generation speed
- Success rate
- Daily usage chart
- Detailed request records with filters and pagination

![Usage Statistics](/blog/images/usage-statistics.png)

How to use it:

1. Start the router service with `ccr start`
2. Open the UI with `ccr ui`
3. Send requests through Claude Code Router, for example with `ccr code`
4. Return to the main dashboard and check the **Usage Statistics** panel

Usage data is stored in:

```shell
~/.claude-code-router/data/usage.jsonl
```

You can also filter records by date range, provider, model, and scenario directly in the UI.

If the `token-speed` plugin is enabled, the panel will also show TTFT and tokens-per-second metrics. Without that plugin, token counts and request statistics still work, but TTFT and speed may appear as `-`.

For API-based access, Claude Code Router also provides:

- `GET /api/usage` — paginated records with summary
- `GET /api/usage/summary` — summary only
- `DELETE /api/usage` — clear usage data

### 5. CLI Model Management

For users who prefer terminal-based workflows, you can use the interactive CLI model selector:

```shell
ccr model
```
![](blog/images/models.gif)

This command provides an interactive interface to:

- View current configuration:
- See all configured models (default, background, think, longContext, webSearch, image)
- Switch models: Quickly change which model is used for each router type
- Add new models: Add models to existing providers
- Create new providers: Set up complete provider configurations including:
   - Provider name and API endpoint
   - API key
   - Available models
   - Transformer configuration with support for:
     - Multiple transformers (openrouter, deepseek, gemini, etc.)
     - Transformer options (e.g., maxtoken with custom limits)
     - Provider-specific routing (e.g., OpenRouter provider preferences)

The CLI tool validates all inputs and provides helpful prompts to guide you through the configuration process, making it easy to manage complex setups without editing JSON files manually.

### 6. Presets Management

Presets allow you to save, share, and reuse configurations easily. You can export your current configuration as a preset and install presets from files or URLs.

```shell
# Export current configuration as a preset
ccr preset export my-preset

# Export with metadata
ccr preset export my-preset --description "My OpenAI config" --author "Your Name" --tags "openai,production"

# Install a preset from local directory
ccr preset install /path/to/preset

# List all installed presets
ccr preset list

# Show preset information
ccr preset info my-preset

# Delete a preset
ccr preset delete my-preset
```

**Preset Features:**
- **Export**: Save your current configuration as a preset directory (with manifest.json)
- **Install**: Install presets from local directories
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: API keys and other sensitive data are automatically sanitized during export (marked as `{{field}}` placeholders)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Presets can include input schemas for collecting required information during installation
- **Version Control**: Each preset includes version metadata for tracking updates

**Preset File Structure:**
```
~/.claude-code-router/presets/
├── my-preset/
│   └── manifest.json    # Contains configuration and metadata
```

### 7. Activate Command (Environment Variables Setup)

The `activate` command allows you to set up environment variables globally in your shell, enabling you to use the `claude` command directly or integrate Claude Code Router with applications built using the Agent SDK.

To activate the environment variables, run:

```shell
eval "$(ccr activate)"
```

This command outputs the necessary environment variables in shell-friendly format, which are then set in your current shell session. After activation, you can:

- **Use `claude` command directly**: Run `claude` commands without needing to use `ccr code`. The `claude` command will automatically route requests through Claude Code Router.
- **Integrate with Agent SDK applications**: Applications built with the Anthropic Agent SDK will automatically use the configured router and models.

The `activate` command sets the following environment variables:

- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: API key from your configuration
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: The local router endpoint (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3456`)
- `NO_PROXY`: Set to `127.0.0.1` to prevent proxy interference
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`: Disables telemetry
- `DISABLE_COST_WARNINGS`: Disables cost warnings
- `API_TIMEOUT_MS`: API timeout from your configuration

> **Note**: Make sure the Claude Code Router service is running (`ccr start`) before using the activated environment variables. The environment variables are only valid for the current shell session. To make them persistent, you can add `eval "$(ccr activate)"` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

#### Providers

The `Providers` array is where you define the different model providers you want to use. Each provider object requires:

- `name`: A unique name for the provider.
- `api_base_url`: The full API endpoint for chat completions.
- `api_key`: Your API key for the provider.
- `models`: A list of model names available from this provider.
- `transformer` (optional): Specifies transformers to process requests and responses.

#### Transformers

Transformers allow you to modify the request and response payloads to ensure compatibility with different provider APIs.

- **Global Transformer**: Apply a transformer to all models from a provider. In this example, the `openrouter` transformer is applied to all models under the `openrouter` provider.
  ```json
  {
    "name": "openrouter",
    "api_base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    "api_key": "sk-xxx",
    "models": [
      "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview",
      "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
    ],
    "transformer": { "use": ["openrouter"] }
  }
  ```
- **Model-Specific Transformer**: Apply a transformer to a specific model. In this example, the `deepseek` transformer is applied to all models, and an additional `tooluse` transformer is applied only to the `deepseek-chat` model.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "deepseek",

    "api_key": "sk-xxx",
    "models": ["moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct"],
    "transformer": {
      "use": [
        [
          "maxtoken",
          {
            "max_tokens": 16384
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

**Available Built-in Transformers:**

- `Anthropic`:If you use only the `Anthropic` transformer, it will preserve the original request and response parameters(you can use it to connect directly to an Anthropic endpoint).
- `deepseek`: Adapts requests/responses for DeepSeek API.
- `gemini`: Adapts requests/responses for Gemini API.
- `openrouter`: Adapts requests/responses for OpenRouter API. It can also accept a `provider` routing parameter to specify which underlying providers OpenRouter should use. For more details, refer to the [OpenRouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing). See an example below:
  ```json
    "transformer": {
      "use": ["openrouter"],
      "moonshotai/kimi-k2": {
        "use": [
          [
            "openrouter",
            {
              "provider": {
                "only": ["moonshotai/fp8"]
              }
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ```
- `groq`: Adapts requests/responses for groq API.
- `maxtoken`: Sets a specific `max_tokens` value.
- `tooluse`: Optimizes tool usage for certain models via `tool_choice`.
- `gemini-cli` (experimental): Unofficial support for Gemini via Gemini CLI [gemini-cli.js](https://gist.github.com/musistudio/1c13a65f35916a7ab690649d3df8d1cd).
- `reasoning`: Used to process the `reasoning_content` field.
- `sampling`: Used to process sampling information fields such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `repetition_penalty`.
- `enhancetool`: Adds a layer of error tolerance to the tool call parameters returned by the LLM (this will cause the tool call information to no longer be streamed).
- `cleancache`: Clears the `cache_control` field from requests.
- `vertex-gemini`: Handles the Gemini API using Vertex authentication.
- `chutes-glm` Unofficial support for GLM 4.5 model via Chutes [chutes-glm-transformer.js](https://gist.github.com/vitobotta/2be3f33722e05e8d4f9d2b0138b8c863).
- `qwen-cli` (experimental): Unofficial support for qwen3-coder-plus model via Qwen CLI [qwen-cli.js](https://gist.github.com/musistudio/f5a67841ced39912fd99e42200d5ca8b).
- `rovo-cli` (experimental): Unofficial support for gpt-5 via Atlassian Rovo Dev CLI [rovo-cli.js](https://gist.github.com/SaseQ/c2a20a38b11276537ec5332d1f7a5e53).

**Custom Transformers:**

You can also create your own transformers and load them via the `transformers` field in `config.json`.

```json
{
  "transformers": [
    {
      "path": "/User/xxx/.claude-code-router/plugins/gemini-cli.js",
      "options": {
        "project": "xxx"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Router

The `Router` object defines which model to use for different scenarios:

- `default`: The default model for general tasks.
- `background`: A model for background tasks. This can be a smaller, local model to save costs.
- `think`: A model for reasoning-heavy tasks, like Plan Mode.
- `longContext`: A model for handling long contexts (e.g., > 60K tokens).
- `longContextThreshold` (optional): The token count threshold for triggering the long context model. Defaults to 60000 if not specified.
- `webSearch`: Used for handling web search tasks and this requires the model itself to support the feature. If you're using openrouter, you need to add the `:online` suffix after the model name.
- `image` (beta): Used for handling image-related tasks (supported by CCR’s built-in agent). If the model does not support tool calling, you need to set the `config.forceUseImageAgent` property to `true`.

- You can also switch models dynamically in Claude Code with the `/model` command:
`/model provider_name,model_name`
Example: `/model openrouter,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`

#### Custom Router

For more advanced routing logic, you can specify a custom router script via the `CUSTOM_ROUTER_PATH` in your `config.json`. This allows you to implement complex routing rules beyond the default scenarios.

In your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "CUSTOM_ROUTER_PATH": "/User/xxx/.claude-code-router/custom-router.js"
}
```

The custom router file must be a JavaScript module that exports an `async` function. This function receives the request object and the config object as arguments and should return the provider and model name as a string (e.g., `"provider_name,model_name"`), or `null` to fall back to the default router.

Here is an example of a `custom-router.js` based on `custom-router.example.js`:

```javascript
// /User/xxx/.claude-code-router/custom-router.js

/**
 * A custom router function to determine which model to use based on the request.
 *
 * @param {object} req - The request object from Claude Code, containing the request body.
 * @param {object} config - The application's config object.
 * @returns {Promise<string|null>} - A promise that resolves to the "provider,model_name" string, or null to use the default router.
 */
module.exports = async function router(req, config) {
  const userMessage = req.body.messages.find((m) => m.role === "user")?.content;

  if (userMessage && userMessage.includes("explain this code")) {
    // Use a powerful model for code explanation
    return "openrouter,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet";
  }

  // Fallback to the default router configuration
  return null;
};
```

##### Subagent Routing

For routing within subagents, you must specify a particular provider and model by including `<CCR-SUBAGENT-MODEL>provider,model</CCR-SUBAGENT-MODEL>` at the **beginning** of the subagent's prompt. This allows you to direct specific subagent tasks to designated models.

**Example:**

```
<CCR-SUBAGENT-MODEL>openrouter,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet</CCR-SUBAGENT-MODEL>

## Status Line (Beta)

To better monitor the status of Claude Code Router at runtime, the project includes a built-in status line tool that can be enabled from the UI.

![statusline-config.png](/blog/images/statusline-config.png)

How to use it:

1. Open the UI with `ccr ui`
2. Enable **StatusLine** in the configuration panel
3. Save the configuration and restart the service with `ccr restart`
4. Start Claude Code with `ccr code`

> The built-in status line is injected automatically when Claude Code is launched with `ccr code`.

The status line supports token-related variables such as:

- `{{inputTokens}}`
- `{{outputTokens}}`
- `{{tokenSpeed}}`

This makes it possible to display input tokens, output tokens, and streaming speed directly in the terminal while requests are running.

The effect is as follows (featuring the new gradient-colored Context progress bar):

## 🤖 GitHub Actions

Integrate Claude Code Router into your CI/CD pipeline. After setting up [Claude Code Actions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions), modify your `.github/workflows/claude.yaml` to use the router:

```yaml
name: Claude Code

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  # ... other triggers

jobs:
  claude:
    if: |
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')) ||
      # ... other conditions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
      issues: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Prepare Environment
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
          mkdir -p $HOME/.claude-code-router
          cat << 'EOF' > $HOME/.claude-code-router/config.json
          {
            "log": true,
            "NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE": true,
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}",
            "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://api.deepseek.com",
            "OPENAI_MODEL": "deepseek-chat"
          }
          EOF
        shell: bash

      - name: Start Claude Code Router
        run: |
          nohup ~/.bun/bin/bunx @wengine-ai/claude-code-router-next@latest start &
        shell: bash

      - name: Run Claude Code
        id: claude
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3456
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: "any-string-is-ok"
```

> **Note**: When running in GitHub Actions or other automation environments, make sure to set `"NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE": true` in your configuration to prevent the process from hanging due to stdin handling issues.

This setup allows for interesting automations, like running tasks during off-peak hours to reduce API costs.

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Model Family Routing

Claude Code Router supports **model family routing**, mapping Claude Code's model tiers (opus/sonnet/haiku) to different provider models. This enables intelligent cost control: main process keeps the same model for cache hits, while subagents can auto-downgrade.

#### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "Router": {
    "enableFamilyRouting": true,
    "families": {
      "opus": {
        "default": "Zhipu Coding Plan,glm-5",
        "think": "DeepSeek,deepseek-reasoner",
        "longContext": "Alibaba Cloud,qwen3-plus",
        "webSearch": "Gemini,gemini-2.5-flash",
        "fallback": {
          "default": ["Alibaba Cloud,glm-4", "DeepSeek,deepseek-chat"],
          "think": ["Alibaba Cloud,qwen-plus", "DeepSeek,deepseek-reasoner"]
        }
      },
      "sonnet": {
        "default": "OpenRouter,deepseek/deepseek-v3",
        "think": "DeepSeek,deepseek-reasoner",
        "fallback": {
          "default": ["Alibaba Cloud,qwen-turbo", "Gemini,gemini-2.0-flash"]
        }
      },
      "haiku": {
        "default": "Alibaba Cloud,qwen-turbo",
        "fallback": {
          "default": ["Gemini,gemini-2.0-flash-lite"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Scenario Types

| Scenario | Trigger Condition | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `default` | Default | Daily conversations and code generation |
| `think` | Plan Mode | Complex reasoning, architecture design |
| `longContext` | tokens > 60000 | Large file analysis |
| `webSearch` | web_search tool | Web search tasks |
| `background` | Background tasks | Auto commits, simple checks |

### Fallback Mechanism

When a primary model fails, Router automatically tries fallback models in the chain to ensure requests don't fail.

#### Workflow

1. **Health Check**: Each provider/model maintains health status
   - `closed` (healthy) → Green indicator
   - `open` (fail pool) → Red indicator, auto skipped
   - `half-open` (recovering) → Yellow indicator

2. **Provider Master Toggle**: In the control panel, each provider has an independent enable/disable switch:
   - **Highest Priority**: When a provider is turned off, all its models are immediately disabled and cannot be selected. The health indicator is grayed out.
   - **Smart Fallback**: If a primary routing model's provider is disabled, the router immediately initiates fallback logic. If any backup model in the fallback chain belongs to a disabled provider, it is skipped automatically.
   - **Probe Exemption**: Disabled providers are completely excluded from active health check probes, preventing redundant upstream network calls.
   - **Warning Warnings**: If any currently configured main routing model (e.g. `default`) belongs to a disabled provider, a warning message is displayed below the select dropdown to alert the administrator.

3. **Failure Detection**: After 3 consecutive failures, enters `open` status

4. **Drag Ordering**: The UI supports dragging fallback models to adjust priority. Models higher in the list are tried first.

5. **Fallback Promotion**: When primary fails and fallback succeeds, the fallback model is temporarily "promoted" (TTL 10 min). Subsequent requests use the promoted model directly, avoiding repeated attempts on the failed primary.

6. **Auto Recovery**: Every 5 minutes, probe failed models. On success → `half-open`, then 2 more successes → `closed`.

#### Fallback Configuration Priority

```
family fallback → global fallback
```

Use family-specific fallback first, then global fallback.

```json
{
  "Router": {
    "enableFallback": true,
    "families": {
      "opus": {
        "fallback": {
          "default": ["Alibaba Cloud,glm-4", "DeepSeek,deepseek-chat"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "fallback": {
    "default": ["OpenRouter,deepseek/deepseek-v3", "Gemini,gemini-2.5-flash"],
    "think": ["DeepSeek,deepseek-reasoner"]
  }
}
```

### Usage Statistics

Router provides comprehensive usage tracking:

#### Quota Monitoring

UI displays real-time quota usage for each provider:

- **5h Quota**: Short-window limit (5-hour reset)
- **7d Quota**: Weekly limit (7-day reset)
- **Reset Time**: Next quota reset timestamp

![Quota usage bars](/blog/images/provider-quota-usage.png)

Supported providers:
- Zhipu GLM Coding Plan
- Alibaba Cloud Qwen Coding Plan
- Kimi Coding Plan
- MiniMax Coding Plan
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- SiliconFlow

#### Usage Records

Each request logs detailed statistics:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `inputTokens` | Input token count |
| `outputTokens` | Output token count |
| `cacheReadInputTokens` | Cache read tokens |
| `cacheCreationInputTokens` | Cache creation tokens |
| `ttft` | Time to first token (ms) |
| `tokensPerSecond` | Output speed |
| `durationMs` | Request duration |
| `status` | success / error |
